# Rainfall_simulator
This is the final project for course MATH-SHU 251, Introduction to Math Modeling. We simulate the quantity of rain fall on the front window of the car with different speed and wiper frequency in this project.

## Usage
For videos with hollow rain_drop representing the raindrops, run `plotter_fast.m`.

For more beautiful rain_drop, run `plotter.m`.

You can change parameters in workspace to simulate process with different parameters.
